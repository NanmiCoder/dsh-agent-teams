 * Durable AgentTeams session events and their emitter.

 * the session log deterministically (same mechanism as `tool-workflow`'s
 * `tool-workflow/*` record events). Events append to the captain's session
 * even when a member agent performed the mutation, so the captain's
 * conversation stream stays the single authoritative monitor surface.
 *
 * Types and the `SessionEventMap` merge live in `event-types.ts` (zero
 * imports) so the browser program can load them without host augmentations.
